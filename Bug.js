This error occurs when you try to access a state variable or a prop before it has been initialized. This often happens when a component renders before its data has been fetched or passed down from a parent component.  It can manifest in different ways, such as undefined is not an object (evaluating 'this.state.variable') or similar messages related to accessing properties of undefined values.  This is especially common in asynchronous operations where data fetching might take some time.
